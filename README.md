## OPP-SCHOOL-LIBRARY-APP
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I created will allow you to:

Add new students or teachers.
Add new books.
Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
